# Covid_tracker_2021
App which shows realtime data related to coronavirus cases
 This application is used to track real-time data about coronavirus cases all over the world.
• To fetch the real-time data https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19 was used as the API which gives the data of around 108 countries.
• The app uses animation cards from the lottiefiles.com, Glide library for image loading, volley library to interact with the rest API and other third-party libraries like https://github.com/blackfizz/EazeGraph for the pie chart graph implementation.
• The reason to develop this app was to learn about API implementations and third-party library integration.
